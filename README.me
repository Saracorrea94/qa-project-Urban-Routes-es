🚖 Urban Routes Test Automation

📝 Project Overview
Automated testing project for the complete taxi request flow in the Urban Routes platform.
Built using Selenium WebDriver and the Page Object Model (POM) pattern, this project simulates the real user experience when ordering a taxi — from route selection to payment confirmation.

Test Flow Includes:
🗺️ Route selection → 🚕 Taxi request → 📞 Phone confirmation → 💳 Payment method → 💬 Preferences and comments.

💻 Technologies Used
Python

Selenium WebDriver

Page Object Model (POM)

WebDriverWait and Expected Conditions (EC)

Pytest (optional for integration)

Chrome DevTools (to capture phone confirmation codes)

👩‍💼 Key Responsibilities
Designed and implemented automated end-to-end test scenarios simulating the full user flow on the Urban Routes platform.

Applied the Page Object Model (POM) to ensure modular, scalable, and maintainable test scripts.

Interacted with UI elements including inputs, buttons, modals, sliders, and scrollable areas.

Utilized multiple locator strategies such as ID, CLASS_NAME, XPATH, and CSS_SELECTOR.

Developed reusable utility functions to reduce code duplication and improve test readability.

Captured dynamic phone confirmation codes using Chrome DevTools for realistic validation.

🚀 Impact & Achievements
Automated a previously manual 5-step taxi request process, increasing test coverage and saving over 60% in execution time.

Ensured UI consistency and functional accuracy, helping maintain a seamless user experience.

Delivered clean and organized code following industry standards and naming conventions.
